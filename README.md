# Pathfinding-Visualizer
Check out my pathfinding visualizer: https://bengavrilov.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/

# Welcome to my Pathfinding Visualizer #
This pathfinding visualizer shows many common pathfinding algorithms used in the tech industry in action! There is a tutorial upon entering the application that shows users how to maneuver the app. I hope you enjoy using it just as much as I do. Here is the link: https://bengavrilov.github.io/Path-Finding-Visualizer/

# Algorithms Used #
**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path.
<br />
**A star Search** (weighted): uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's algorithm. One major drawback is its space complexity.
<br />
**Breadth-first Search** (unweighted): fundamental algorithm; guarantees the shortest path.
<br />
**Depth-first Search** (unweighted): not ideal for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path.
